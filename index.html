		<hr width="40%"align="center">
		
		<p><b><u>The concept of halal products or foods </u></b>is now gaining a worldwide discussion due to its recognition as an alternative
         benchmark for <b>safety, hygiene</b> and quality assurance of what we consume or drink daily. Thus products or foods that
         are produced in line with halal prescriptions are readily acceptable by Muslim consumers as well as consumers from
         other religions. For a Muslim consumer, halal foods and drinks means that the products has met the requirements laid
         down by the Shariah law whereas for a non-Muslim consumer, it represents the symbol of hygiene, quality and safety
         product when produced strictly under the Holistic Halal Assurance Management System. Therefore, consumers
         nowadays are so much concerned and always be aware of what they eat, drink and use.<br> The awareness of the Muslim
         and non-Muslim consumers describes their perception and cognitive reaction to products or foods in the market. As
         such, their awareness is an internal state or a viscer al feeling by way of sensory perception towards the
         products/foods they used or consumed. Given the significance role of awareness about halal in the life of Muslims
         and their obligations to be Shariah compliant; this paper will address the determinants and identify the sources of
         awareness of Muslim consumers on halal products or foods. It is argued that many things can lead to awareness of
         halal products or food unfortunately, most of the previous studies only focused on halal certification logo. Ma ny
         problems are associated with halal logo (labeling) as the only source of awareness for Muslim consumers on halal.
         This logo is also yet to be empirically proven as well. This paper delves into other sources that can bring about
         awareness of Muslims on halal products in order to fill the void. Methodologically, the paper utilizes both qualitative
         and quantitative approaches. Qualitatively, the paper delves in to literatures to identify those alternative ways and
         quantitatively tests them through self-administered survey using Partial Least Square (PLS). The findings show that
         the religious belief, exposure, certification logo, and health reason are potential sources of Muslim awareness abo</p>
